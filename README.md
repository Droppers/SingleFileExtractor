# Install
To use this tool install it as a global dotnet tool:
```
dotnet tool install -g sfextract
```

# Usage
## Command-line
```
sfextract [file] -o|--output [directory]
```

<b>Extract files</b><br>
```
sfextract Application.exe -o path/to/output/
```

<b>List files</b><br>
Omitting the output directory will list all files in the single file executable.
```
sfextract Application.exe
```

## Programmatically

Install the `SingleFileExtractor.Core` NuGet package to use it programmatically:
```csharp
var reader = new ExecutableReader("application.exe");
```

### Read startup info

When you want to know what the entry point assembly is, you can read the startup info

```cs
var reader = new ExecutableReader("application.exe");
var startupInfo = reader.StartupInfo;
```

### Extract all files

```cs
var reader = new ExecutableReader("application.exe");

// Validate if executable is a single file executable, and can be extracted
var isSingleFile = reader.IsSingleFile;

if (isSingleFile)
{
    // Extract specific file entry
    await reader.Manifest.Entries[0].ExtractToFileAsync("example.dll");
    // , or create an in-memory stream of a specifc file entry
    var stream = await reader.Manifest.Entries[0].AsStreamAsync()
    
    // Extract all files to a directory
    await reader.ExtractToDirectoryAsync("path/to/output");
}
```

### Extract specific entry to file

```cs
var reader = new ExecutableReader("application.exe");
await reader.Manifest.Entries[0].ExtractToFileAsync("example.dll");
```

### Extract specific entry to stream

```cs
var reader = new ExecutableReader("application.exe");
var stream = await reader.Manifest.Entries[0].AsStreamAsync()
```

## Why
Another application I'm working on requires me to extract the contents of a single file. Since I've also seen people asking for a way to do this, I decided to turn it into a dotnet tool and NuGet package.
